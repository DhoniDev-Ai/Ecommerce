<p>Sea buckthorn is a fruit that many people are still unaware of, even though it has been growing naturally in India for a very long time. It is a small, bright orange fruit that grows on a thorny bush. The word "sea" in its name often causes confusion, but the plant has no connection to the sea. The word "sea" comes from an old botanical name, which later became part of its English name. In fact, this plant grows far from the sea.</p>

<p>In India, sea buckthorn is primarily found in high-altitude regions such as Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, and Arunachal Pradesh. These areas are characterized by extreme cold, rocky soil, and thin air. Most plants cannot survive in such conditions, but sea buckthorn thrives. Because it grows in such a harsh environment, its fruits are rich in natural nutrients. Local people also know it by other names such as Leh berry and Charma.</p>

<p>Sea buckthorn fruits grow very close together on the branches. Due to the thorns on the branches and the delicate nature of the fruits, harvesting them is not easy. Farmers have to carefully collect the fruits to avoid damaging them and injuring themselves. This is one of the reasons why the fruit is considered quite valuable.</p>

<p>Fresh sea buckthorn fruits spoil very quickly. Therefore, they are rarely found fresh in the market. To prevent spoilage, they are processed immediately after harvesting. Sea buckthorn is therefore commonly available in forms such as juice, pulp, oil, powder, capsules, and concentrate.</p>

<p>Sea buckthorn is known for its natural nutritional value. It contains Vitamin C, Vitamin E, beta-carotene, and other plant-derived compounds. It also contains some rare natural fatty acids, such as omega-7, which are not commonly found in most foods. These natural elements are responsible for its vibrant color and distinctive characteristics.</p>

<p>For centuries, people living in cold regions like Ladakh and Tibet have considered sea buckthorn an integral part of their traditional lifestyle, especially during the long and harsh winters.</p>
